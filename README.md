# Dinner Party Planner
The Dinner Party Planner is an interactive website allowing users to explore different meals and drinks. Both the meal and drink page allow the user to search for results by ingredient, by name, or by letting the application randomly find the user a drink or meal. Users also have the option to save their results to their "favorite" page.
