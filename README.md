# Dinner Party Planner

## Overview
- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.

### User Story
- As the host of an upcoming dinner party, I want to find interesting drinks and food entrees, so that I can prepare a menu that will impress my friends.
- As a user I want to search for both drinks and food items by things I am familiar with, such as a main ingredient or area of origin.
- I also want to have a recipe to follow, as well as be able to find past recipes so I can make the same items in the future.
